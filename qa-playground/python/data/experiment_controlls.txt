# Use this file to set specific behaviors for specific titles during experiment simulation
# To help create predictable experiments with verifiable results for:
# 1. Conversions
# 2. Avg View Durations
# 3. Completed Views (view portions)

# views portion determines how much each title should be viewed in percent for completion test {title:percent}
views_portion={'Traces of Red': 90, 'Blockers': 75, 'The Range Rider':97, 'The Double Life of Henry Phyfe': 79, 'The Arrival of Josie': 75,'The Simpsons': 100}
